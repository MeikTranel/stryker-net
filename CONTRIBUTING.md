## Getting started developing Stryker.NET
To develop features for Stryker.NET, we suggest using Visual Studio 2015, 2017 or Visual Studio Code.

1. Please create an issue first so we know what you're going to be working on
2. Create a fork on your github account.
3. Install the [.NET Core 1.1 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core)
3. If you're working in Visual Studio, install the [.NET Compiler Platform SDK](https://aka.ms/roslynsdktemplates)
4. Clone your fork and build the application to see if everything works
5. Are you going to be writing new mutators? Be sure to read '[Getting Started C# Syntax Analysis](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/wiki/Getting-Started-C%23-Syntax-Analysis)' and '[Getting Started C# Syntax Transformation](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/wiki/Getting-Started-C%23-Syntax-Transformation)'
6. When writing code please create or edit unit tests or integration tests.
7. If you're done changing code, make a pull request on the Stryker.NET repo.
