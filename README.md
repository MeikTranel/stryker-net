# Styker.NET
*Professor X: For someone who hates mutants... you certainly keep some strange company.*  
*William Stryker: Oh, they serve their purpose... as long as they can be controlled.*

## Getting started
Stryker.NET offers you mutation testing for your .NET projects. It allows you to test your tests by temporarily inserting bugs.

The project is still in its early days and is not ready to use on your applications.
